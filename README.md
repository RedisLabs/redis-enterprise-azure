# Automated Testing Redis Enterprise Pack (Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack) on Azure 

Simple automated setup for a Redis Enterprise Pack (Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack) deployment on Azure. Ideal for build up and teardown of test environments or functional tests. Works with Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack v4.4 or later. 

## Getting Started
- Choose the correct Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack version to deploy for your environment in settings.sh under ````rp_download```` and ````rp_binaries````
- Provide Azure subscription and account details in the settings.sh under ````azure_account```` and ````azure_subscription_id````
- Provide the ceritificates for vm provisioning in settings.sh under ````vm_auth_cert_public```` and ````vm_auth_cert_private````
- Run ````create_azure_cluster.sh```` 
- For teardown use delete_azure_cluster.sh to destroy the cluster.

_Limitations_: TBD

# Details

## OSx Scripts: 
OSx script for setting up a multi node Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack cluster on Azure VMs.

### Prerequisites
install_prereqs.sh: Install required dependencies like node and azure-cli. Run this before your first run.

### Create Azure Cluster (create_azure_cluster.sh)
Main script to create the VMs, download and install Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack and set up the cluster with a final rebalance. Will require you to login to your Azure account. 
Settings will also, by default, allow a Windows Server jumpbox to be configured in the same vnet (see the vnet_name. setting above for details on vnets). The jumpbox ensures you don't expose your Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack directly to the internet. You can disable the jumpbox if you are using an existing vnet where you already have a browser to administer Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack, Or if you are simply looking to administer through the Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack commandline interface. 

### Delete Azure Cluster (delete_azure_cluster.sh)
used to clean up the jumpbox, cluster and vms. Will require you to login to your Azure account. cleanup looks for the vm_name_prefix set in the settings file to match and delete VMs. To ensure it does not do accidental deletes, enable_fast_delete is off by default. You can enable_fast_delete, however make sure your prefix is unique and does not match your existing VMs in your subscription. 

### Start, Shutdown and Restart Azure Cluster (start_azure_cluster.sh, shutdown_azure_cluster.sh, restart_azure_cluster.sh)
used to manipulate the cluter vms for simplifying a cluster restart, shutdown or start. Will require you to login to your Azure account. 
Scripts looks for the vm_name_prefix set in the settings file to match and delete VMs. To ensure it does not do accidental shutdown or restarts, 
enable_fast_restart, enable_fast_start, enable_fast_shutdown, is off by default. You can the settings, however make sure your prefix is unique 
and does not match your existing VMs in your subscription. 


### Settings (settings.sh)
settings.sh: setting file for the automated cluster setup. Seach for and investigate the variables marked with text "TODO" in the setting file before running create_ and delete_ scripts. 
NOTE: The scripts will fail by default as Azure subscription and account information will need to be populated.

**Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack Settings:**
````
    rp_total_nodes: set the number of nodes in the cluster.
    
    rp_download: link to the download URL for ubuntu 14.04 version Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack. 
    
    rp_binary: name of the binary for Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack. used to help rename the downloaded 
    binary. 
    
    rp_license_file: reference to the local rp license file in the form a of a local path "~/path_to_rp_license_file.txt"

    rp_admin_account_name: database administration account for Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack cluster. 
    TODO: change this value before use. 
    
    rp_admin_account_password: database administration password for Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack 
    cluster. TODO: change this value before use.  
````

**Azure Config Settings:**
````
    azure_account: your fully qualified azure account. account you use to login to portal. best 
    practice is to use a delegate admin account to protect against account compromise. 
    TODO: change this value before use.
    
    azure_subscription_id: azure subscription id for the azure account. if you don't know your 
    subscription id, use "azure login -u account" +  "azure account show" to get  account and 
    subscriptionid. TODO: change this value before use.
    
    auth_cert_public: auth public key used for provisioning the Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack nodes on 
    ubuntu. TODO: change this value before use. use ssh-keygen to generate the keys - public 
    and private keys. 
    
    auth_cert_private: auth private key used for logging in with ssh without passwords.  
    
    region: azure region for the setup. default is "us-west". TODO: change this value before 
    use. use ssh-keygen to generate the keys - public and private keys. 
    
    vm_name_prefix: prefix to the vm names created by the script. it is important to pick a 
    unique prefix name that does not match any of the other VM names in your subscription. 
    delete_azure_cluster script deletes nodes matching this prefix. 
    
    vnet_name: virtual network name for the Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack subnet. vnet setup is done for 
    network communication efficiency with the Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack cluster. virtual network (vnets) 
    enable private 10.0.*.* IPs in a single subnet for all VMs including the jumpbox.
    
    service_name: service name ensure ssh and jumpbox RDP addresses can be under a single cloud 
    service name with different port names. jumpbox gets 3389 rdp port and all Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack 
    nodes gets port 1..N for ssh. for example:
        RDP into the jumpbox: service_name.cloudapp.net:3398
        SSH into the first node: ssh -p 1 cb_vmadmin@service_name.cloudapp.net
````

**Azure Jumpbox VM Config Settings:**
````
    disable jumpbox: 1 to diable jumpbox. jumpbox is provisioned for security reasons. Without 
    a node within the same vnet, you end up exposing your database directly to the internet, 
    opening Web Console (8443) and other Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack ports to the public internet. 
    
    jumpbox_image_name: image to use for the jumpbox. using windows server by default
    
    jumpbox_vm_sku: vm sku to use on azure for jumpbox vm 
    
    jumpbox_vm_admin_account_name: account name for jumpbox vm admin.
    
    jumpbox_vm_admin_account_password: account password for jumpbox vm admin.
````

**Azure Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack Nodes VM Config Settings:**
````
    rp_vm_image_name: ubuntu OS image to use on azure for Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack cluster nodes.
    
    rp_vm_sku: vm sku to use on azure for Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack cluster node vms.
    
    rp_vm_admin_account_name: account name for Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack node vm admin. certs 
    are used for password-less logins.
````
**Misc Config**
````
    remove_known_hosts: this will enable removing the .ssh/known_hosts file under MacOS. The 
    file gets in the way of reprovisioning the same node names for the cluster.
    
    enable_fast_delete: enable fast delete will supress confirmation on deletes of each VM. do 
    this only if you are certain delete will not harm your existing VMs and you have tried the 
    script multiple times.
